This is one of the things that separates Judaism from Christianity.  I think most Christians and Jews don't appreciate 

Judaism is a religious family so you're born Jewish.  The only way to leave a family is to choose another family but as long you don't choose another family you can dislike your family. Many of us do right, but you're still part of the family. So Jews have this very close connection now to these two systems (religion and religious family) They each have advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage of having a religion is it's much more easily spread because if you have somebody with a completely different culture who says I believe in Jesus they're Christian like you are. The advantage of having a religious family is Jews feel a powerful sense of connection to one another and that's why when Jews are in trouble in a far-flung land you can be sure that there will be a Jewish rescue attempt. You can be sure of it because you feel that familial connection in a way that Christians don't

In my view you can't have your cake and eat it too.  Economic power is political power.  I see you blame the state for its relationship with capitalists, but I see it as inverse.  You can't have capitalism without state corruption.  This is so clear in animal agriculture, sugar, coke, big pharma, etc. in the US right now.
